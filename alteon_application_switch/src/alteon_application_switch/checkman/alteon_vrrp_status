description:
  The state of virtual interfaces on the Alteon Application Switch in a Cluster can either be master or slave. This check monitors this state. The state is compared to the initial or configured state.
  The state is determined from OID .1.3.6.1.4.1.1872.2.5.3.3.3.1.1.2 (VRRP State) which delivers the cluster state per virtual interface.
  The state is moitored for each virtual interface, the VRRP Router IP (OID .1.3.6.1.4.1.1872.2.5.3.1.6.3.1.3) is also listed in check output.
  The check is warning, if the state is different from initial or configured state. The check is critical, if the state of all virtual interfaces is not equal.
  Additional Comment: Configure the desired state of all Intances in WATO using regex. If the cluster is switched, change the WATO config accordingly.
