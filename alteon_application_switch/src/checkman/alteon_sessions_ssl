description:
 The Alteon Application Switch is able to handle SSL/TLS Connections. This check moitors the amount of SSL/TLS Connections per Context. OID .1.3.6.1.4.1.1872.2.5.1.2.12 (3.0: Peak, 4.0 Current) are used for Monitoring Sessions in CPS. Due to a Bug in the Alteon Appliances SNMP Interface, this check may return 0 every time. The state will be {WARN/CRIT} if the percentage of current Sessions is higher then the defined percentage of maximum SSL Sessions. The tresold defines the percentage from maximum configured SSL Session, which is determined by OID: .1.3.6.1.4.1.1872.2.5.1.3.10.3.1.2.10.
