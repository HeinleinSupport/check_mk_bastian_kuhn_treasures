# Alertmanger Extended
The Original Version of the Alertmanager Check in Checkmk, does not allow you to remap the severity. This Version of the Check, alows you to do that.

Besides that, everthing is the same as in the original Checkmk Version.

Make sure to Disable the shipped versions of the Alertmanager Checks in Checkmk.
